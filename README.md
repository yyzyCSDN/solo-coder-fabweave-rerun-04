# FabWeave Operations Lab

FabWeave is a dependency-light Python reference project for semiconductor-fab
operations.  Its production modules model queue-time protection, dispatch,
reticle reservations, recipe qualification, SPC, metrology sampling,
maintenance, chamber matching, holds, genealogy, chemical aging, cleanroom
excursions, demand control, rework, lot merging, equipment dedication,
contamination, takt, route yield and shipment commitments.

The scheduling domain (`fabweave.scheduling`) atomically places recipe/chamber
certification runs.  Each run must simultaneously avoid planned maintenance,
keep the chamber cooldown gap, sit inside one qualified engineer's duty shift
and finish while the certification still has usable life.  A batch commits
only when every job fits; otherwise the complete conflict list is returned
without holding any resource.  The solver is deterministic, so identical
inputs produce identical placements across retries.

The cross-domain workflow layer composes these services for material
readiness, dispatch-after-hold, qualified reservations and assignments,
metrology/SPC gates, containment, powered scheduling, rework release,
merge-to-commit and performance reporting.  It preserves domain rejection
reasons instead of replacing them with a generic success or failure.

Shared infrastructure supplies half-open time intervals, versioned policy
history, immutable decisions, quantity conservation and an append-only event
log with optimistic concurrency.  Domain services use these primitives to keep
event-time, idempotency and fail-closed behavior consistent.

Run the tests with `python -m pytest -q`.
